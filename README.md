# Hello there, I am Vicoria Jaja

Welcome to my GitHub where I showcase my projects, achievements, and passion for data analytics.

I am a Data Analyst who loves turning messy and complex data into meaningful stories that contribute to making strategic decisions for businesses. With a background in Petroleum Engineering, graduating with Second Class Honours, I studied statistics, mathematics, and engineering courses that built my analytical mindset and made me naturally curious about how data works and how it can solve real problems. During my undergraduate internship at Shell Petroleum Development Company, I worked in the ICT department, supporting internal data documentation and systems—which gave me my first hands-on tech experience.

In 2023, I got a scholarship into Dataleum Academy, where I learned the basics of data analytics using Excel, SQL, and Power BI. I completed all projects and assignments with 98% and was named among the Top 1% of students. That experience gave me confidence and helped me build a solid foundation.
In 2024, I joined The Data Immersed (TDI) to advance my skills. This community sharpened how I work with large datasets, tell stories with data, and solve real-world problems. My consistency, drive, and growth even earned me a referral gig from one of my tutors, a moment that reminded me I am on the right path.

While learning, I have also worked with clients to handle data entry, clean and analyze datasets of over 30,000 rows, and deliver accurate reports under tight deadlines. I use Excel, Power BI, and SQL regularly, and I am currently learning Python to push myself further.

What makes me unique is how I combine technical skills with a curious mind, strong communication, and a genuine love for learning. I am detail-oriented, strategic, creative, and highly collaborative. These qualities form the foundation of my work, enabling me to translate complex data into meaningful insights that optimize outcomes. I am someone who is putting in the work, one project at a time, and ready to make an impact.
